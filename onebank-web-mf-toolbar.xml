Name: 		CWE
ID: 				3ADB9EE4-5761-4289-8BD3-CBFCC593EBBC
The Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE), co-sponsored and maintained by MITRE, is international in scope and free for public use. CWE provides a unified, measurable set of software weaknesses that is enabling more effective discussion, description, selection, and use of software security tools and services that can find these weaknesses in source code and operational systems as well as better understanding and management of software weaknesses related to architecture and design.

Name: 		CWE Top 25 2019
ID: 				7AF935C9-15AA-45B2-8EEC-0EAE4194ACDE
The 2019 CWE Top 25 Most Dangerous Software Errors lists the most widespread and critical weaknesses that can lead to serious vulnerabilities in software (as demonstrated by the National Vulnerability Database). These weaknesses occur frequently, are often easy to find, and easy to exploit. They are dangerous because they will frequently enable attackers to completely take over the software, steal data, or prevent the software from working at all. The list is the result of heuristic formula that the CWE Team used with a data-driven approach that leveraged the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure (CVE), National Vulnerability Database (NVD), and Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). Due to the hierarchical nature of the CWE taxonomy, Fortify considers all CWE IDs which are children of a Top 25 entry, as included within the context of the entry due to the "CHILD-OF" relationship within the hierarchy. Exercise caution if using only this Top 25 list to prioritize auditing efforts because the software under analysis might not align with the assumptions of the heuristic used to define the Top 25. For example, many of these weaknesses are related to C-like languages and the software under analysis might not be within the C-family of languages - thus, many CWEs would not be in scope.

Name: 		DISA CCI 2
ID: 				7F037130-41E5-40F0-B653-7819A4B3E241
The purpose of a Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Control Correlation Identifier (CCI) is to provide a standard identifier for policy based requirements which connect high-level policy expressions and low-level technical implementations. Associated with each CCI is a description for each of the singular, actionable, statements compromising an information assurance (IA) control or IA best practice. Using CCI allows high-level policy framework security requirements to be decomposed and explicitly associated with low-level implementations, thus enabling the assessment of related compliance assessment results spanning heterogeneous technologies. The current IA controls and best practices associated with each CCI, that are specified in NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4, can be viewed using the DISA STIG Viewer.  
The following table summarizes the number of issues identified across the different CCIs broken down by Fortify Priority Order. The status of a CCI is considered "In Place" when there are no issues reported for a given CCI.  

If the project is missing a Fortify Static Code Analyzer (SCA) scan, or the scan contains findings that have not been fixed, hidden or suppressed, CCI-003187 is not considered "In Place". Similarly, if the project is missing a Micro Focus Fortify WebInspect scan, or the scan contains any critical findings, CCI-000366 and CCI-000256 are not considered "In Place".

Name: 		GDPR
ID: 				771C470C-9274-4580-8556-C12F5E4BEC51
The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) replaces the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC and was designed to harmonize data privacy laws across Europe, to protect and empower all EU citizens data privacy and to reshape the way organizations across the region approach data privacy. Going into effect on May 25, 2018, GDPR provides a framework for organizations on how to handle personal data.        According to GDPR regulation personal data "means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ('data subject'); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person."      GDPR articles that pertain to application security and require businesses to protect personal data during design and development of its product and services are:

   - Article 25, Data protection by design and by default - which requires "The controller shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures for ensuring that, by default, only personal data which are necessary for each specific purpose of the processing are processed."
   - Article 32, Security of processing - which requires businesses to protect its systems and applications "from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to personal data".       This report may be used by organizations as a framework to help identify and protect personal data as it relates to application security.

Name: 		MISRA C 2012
ID: 				555A3A66-A0E1-47AF-910C-3F19A6FB2506
Now in its third edition, the Motor Industry Software Reliability Association (MISRA) C Guidelines describe a subset of the C programming language in which there is reduced risk of introducing mistakes in critical systems. While the MISRA C Guidelines focus upon safety-related software development, a subset of the rules reflects security properties. Fortify interprets the MISRA C Guidelines under the context of security and provides correlation of security vulnerability categories to the rules defined by MISRA. Fortify provides these security focused detection mechanisms with the standard rulepacks, however, further support of the MISRA C Guidelines related to safety can be added through the use of custom rules. The results in this report can assist in the creation of a compliance matrix for MISRA.

ID: 				28083E33-760F-4A1A-AADA-738CC60082AD
The OWASP Application Security Verification Standard establishes a framework of security requirements and controls that focus on functional and non-functional security controls for the software development lifecycle based upon a community-driven effort. OWASP ASVS identifies several application security verification levels, with each level increasing depth:
    
&lt;LI&gt;ASVS Level 1 (L1): for low assurance levels and is completely penetration testable.&lt;/LI&gt; 
&lt;LI&gt;ASVS Level 2 (L2): for applications that contain sensitive data, which requires protection, and is the recommended level for most apps.&lt;/LI&gt; 
&lt;LI&gt;ASVS Level 3 (L3): for the most critical applications - applications that perform high value transactions, contain sensitive medical data, or any application that requires the highest level of trust.&lt;/LI&gt;  &lt;/UL&gt;

The 2009 CWE/SANS Top 25 Programming Errors lists the most significant programming errors that can lead to serious software vulnerabilities. They occur frequently, are often easy to find, and easy to exploit. They are dangerous because they will frequently allow attackers to completely take over the software, steal data, or prevent the software from working at all. The list is the result of collaboration between the SANS Institute, MITRE, and many top software security experts.

SANS Top 25 2010 Most Dangerous Software Errors provides an enumeration of the most widespread and critical errors, categorized by Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) identifiers, that lead to serious vulnerabilities in software (http://cwe.mitre.org/). These software errors are often easy to find and exploit. The inherent danger in these errors is that they can allow an attacker to completely take over the software, steal data, or prevent the software from working at all.

Each requirement or recommendation identified by the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) STIG is represented by a STIG identifier (STIGID), which corresponds to a checklist item and a severity code [APP&lt;I&gt;ID&lt;/I&gt;: CAT &lt;I&gt;SEV&lt;/I&gt;]. DISA STIG defines three severities with respect to vulnerabilities where their:
    
&lt;LI&gt;exploitation leads to direct and immediate loss of Confidentiality, Availability, or Integrity (CAT I).&lt;/LI&gt; 
&lt;LI&gt;exploitation potentially results in loss of Confidentiality, Availability, or Integrity (CAT II).&lt;/LI&gt; 
&lt;LI&gt;existence degrades protections against loss of Confidentiality, Availability, or Integrity (CAT III).&lt;/LI&gt;  &lt;/UL&gt;
  
The following table summarizes the number of issues identified across the different STIGIDs broken down by Fortify Priority Order. The status of a STIGID is considered "In Place" when there are no issues reported for a given STIGID.  

If the project is missing a Fortify Static Code Analyzer (SCA) scan, or the scan contains findings that have not been fixed, hidden or suppressed, STIGID APP5080: CAT II is not considered "In Place". Similarly, if the project is missing a Fortify WebInspect scan, or the scan contains any critical findings, STIGID APP5100: CAT II is not considered "In Place".

DISA STIG identifies several severities with respect to vulnerabilities:
    
&lt;LI&gt;CAT I: allow an attacker immediate access into a machine, allow super user access, or bypass a firewall.&lt;/LI&gt; 
&lt;LI&gt;CAT II: provide information that have a high potential of giving access to an intruder.&lt;/LI&gt;

Similarly, if the project is missing a Fortify WebInspect scan, or the scan contains any critical findings, STIGID APSC-DV-001460: CAT II and STIGID APSC-DV-002930: CAT II are not considered "In Place".

Name: 		STIG 5.1
ID: 				1E2530B5-61C5-45D0-B479-79CB82DAFF83
Each requirement or recommendation identified by the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) STIG is represented by a STIG identifier (STIGID), which corresponds to a checklist item and a severity code [APSC-DV-&lt;I&gt;ID&lt;/I&gt;: CAT &lt;I&gt;SEV&lt;/I&gt;]. DISA STIG defines three severities with respect to vulnerabilities where their:
    
&lt;LI&gt;exploitation leads to direct and immediate loss of Confidentiality, Availability, or Integrity (CAT I).&lt;/LI&gt; 
&lt;LI&gt;exploitation potentially results in loss of Confidentiality, Availability, or Integrity (CAT II).&lt;/LI&gt; 
&lt;LI&gt;existence degrades protections against loss of Confidentiality, Availability, or Integrity (CAT III).&lt;/LI&gt;  &lt;/UL&gt;
